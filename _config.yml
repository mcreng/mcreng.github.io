    supp: <p>I worked on multiple projects involving deep learning and computer vision. The first was to package an existing eye gaze detection model into production, which was planned to help on e-sports training. The second was to develop a model that detects if a person falls. It was based on 3D pose estimation and was planned to be used in nursery homes. I was also involved in other smaller projects on anomaly detection and Chinese paraphrasing.</p>

    supp: <p>We conducted an industrial research project sponsored by AECOM, which aimed to improve the existing Hong Kong Air Ventilation Assessment using data-driven approaches. The research report is available <a href="_files/RIPS-HK2018.pdf">here</a> and I was mainly responsible for section 3. We are currently proceeding further with our research and running more experiments, and we hope to publish a paper on this matter soon.</p>

    supp: <p>We participated in a nation-wide autonomous car racing competition and was awarded Third Class Honour. We also trained new members by holding tutorials on topics in robotics and software engineering. We conducted R&D, such as developing new IC and component library and developing new internal software for training/productivity purposes (more details in 'Projects'). We also hosted STEM competitions for primary and secondary students, and provided guidance to them throughout.</p>
